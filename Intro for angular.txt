 Angular files and folder structure
 Nodemodules:
    1) All the 3rd party libraies where stored in this folder 
    2) This folder purily depends for developer purpose, We don't deploy this folder in production environment.
    3)When we install the other third party libraies that also stored in this nodeModules

 Src Folder:
    1) We need to put all our source code in this folder, we will work most
    2) Inside the source folder we have 
     **app folder
        1. It as ! component and 1 app nodeModules(must have atleast)
        2. whenever we want to create servise, module should be created inside the app folder
     **assets
        1. which have static assets of our application(images,icons,fonts....)
     **environment
        1.Basically used to set up front environment which as 2 files
          $$ environment.ts(development emvir)
          $$ environment.prod.ts
        2. purpose to setup database credential and server ip add

        1.it is a icon file which as displays on the browser(refer index.html file)
     **index.html
        1.Main html file which gets render when angular application runs
        2. Here we don't have have any style sheets and js files because all this dependencies injected to this file 
           during the build process
     **main.ts
        1. it is a Typescript file
        2. starting point angular app , Whenever we run the angulur apllication this file gets started (entry point)
        3. In this file what we are doing is we are bootstraping the main module(appmodule) to this project
     **polyfills.ts
        1. imports some script which are requird to run angular application 
        2. it helps to browser to support any feature upgrade of angulur
     **style.css
        1. global  css file
     ** test.ts --> used to setting testing environment
     **editerconfig
        1. which is used to setup some default set of rule which each developer should follow
     *gitignore
        1. Inthis file we need to specify the files and folder which we have to exclude from the git repository
     **angular.json
       1.Contains all the configuration of our ng project(project name, root folder name, source folder name)
       2.before angular 6 this file as angular.cli.json
     **karma.conf.js --> testing purpose
     **package.json 
       1. standard conf file which every node project has(project name, version)
       2.dependencies:
            $$ List of dependencies which our project dependdent on(ex: angular/core)
            $$ dependencies listed  which is  needed it in production      

       3.devdepencies:
            $$ list of dependencies which is need for development purpose(ex: typescript,angularcli, node....)
            $$ dependencies listed in devdepencies which is not need it in production  
     **tsconfig.json
        1.bunch of setting for typescript complier. Based on this setting it is going to compline typescript code to js code
